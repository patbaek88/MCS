Category,Abbreviation,Full Name,Meaning
Stability & Variable Flow Rate,BFE,Basic Flowability Energy,"The resistance to movement exhibited by the powder."
Stability & Variable Flow Rate,SI,Stability Index,"Physical Stability. 0.9<SI<1.1 means stable. Significantly greater than unity: de-aeration, segregation, agglomeration, moisture uptake. Significantly less than unity: attrition, de-agglomeration or presence of a flow additive."
Stability & Variable Flow Rate,FRI,Flow Rate Index,"A more cohesive powder will generate higher FRI values, while free-flowing materials will exhibit a value close to unity. The presence of flow additives may generate value lower than unity."
Stability & Variable Flow Rate,SE,Specific Energy,A higher value is associated with greater friction and interlocking which may prevent the powder from flowing under certain conditions.
Stability & Variable Flow Rate,CBD,Conditioned Bulk Density,Efficiently packed particles with few void spaces are therefore less compressible and will typically exhibit less cohesive behavior.
Aeration,AE,Aeration Energy,"A high AE measurement suggests that the sample does not effectively aerate at this air velocity. Typically, lower AE is associated with a low degree of interparticular cohesion."
Aeration,AR,Aeration Ratio,"A higher sensitivity to aeration, and is associated with a low degree of interparticular cohesion."
Aeration,NAS,Normalised Aerations Sensitivity,NAS represents a powder's sensitivity to a change in air velocity. The change in Flow Energy is normalised against the magnitude of the change in air velocity allowing the aeration behavior of samples requiring different air velocities to effectively aerate to be more easily compared with each other.
Bulk Parameters,CPS,Compressibility Percentage,"A high CPS indicates that the material is highly compressible"
Bulk Parameters,PD,Pressure Drop across the Powder Bed,"A high Pressure Drop across the bed indicates that it is more difficult to transmit air through the sample, and that the powder has low permeability"
Shear Cell,"6COH, 9COH",Cohesion under 6 or 9 kPa,"A high Cohesion value indicates that the powder would be more difficult to move with purely shearing force."
Shear Cell,"6UYS, 9UYS",Unconfined Yield Strength under 6 or 9 kPa,"A high UYS indicates that the powder bulk would be able to maintain its structure more effectively after a consolidating stress was applied and then all stresses removed, whereas a low UYS would indicate that the sample was more likely to fall apart once previously applied stress was removed."
Shear Cell,"6MPS, 9MPS",Major Principle Stress under 6 or 9 kPa,"A high MPS indicates that the powder behaves more like a solid than a liquid, whereas a low MPS suggests that the powder behaves more hydrostatically."
Shear Cell,"6FF, 9FF",Flow Function under 6 or 9 kPa,"The ratio of MPS to UYS is referred to as the Flow Function. Typically, a high FF indicates a more free-flowing powder, whereas a low FF suggests that powder is highly resistant to flow under this regime."
Shear Cell,"6AIF, 9AIF",Angle of Internal Friction under 6 or 9 kPa,"The AIF is the angle between the x-axis and the Best Fit Line. A high AIF indicates higher friction between the powder planes, and thus a less free-flowing powder in this mode of flow."
Wall Friction,WFA,Wall Friction Angle,"The WFA is the angle between the x-axis and the linear Best-Fit Line to the five measured data points. A high WFA indicates that the powder would be less free-flowing against the wall surface at high stresses, whereas a low WFA suggests the powder would flow freely against the surface and not be impeded by it."
